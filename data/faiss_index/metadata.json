Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but the broadcast domain can\nbe divided by switches using the concept of VLAN.\nA broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the\ndevices in the same broadcast domain will receive it. The devices in the same broadcast domain\nwill receive all the broadcast packets but it is limited to switches only as routers don\u2019t forward\nout the broadcast packet. To forward out the packets to different VLAN (from one VLAN to\nanother) or broadcast domains, inter Vlan routing is needed. Through VLAN, different small-\nsize sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle.\nLAN ranges:\n\u25cf VLAN 0, 4095: These are reserved VLAN which cannot be seen or used."}, {"pdf": "Chapter_6.1 (1).pdf", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "LAN ranges:\n\u25cf VLAN 0, 4095: These are reserved VLAN which cannot be seen or used.\n\u25cf VLAN 1: It is the default VLAN of switches.
