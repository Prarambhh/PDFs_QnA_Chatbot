A Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure. It plays a fundamental role in connecting users to websites, services, and resources across the World Wide Web. It is essentially the “phone book’ of the internet, translating user-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers and network devices use to locate one another on the internet. From user computer do a DNS query to ISP’s recursive DNS server: When a user enters a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into a web browser, their computer sends a DNS queries to their Internet Service Provider’S (ISP) DNS server.
