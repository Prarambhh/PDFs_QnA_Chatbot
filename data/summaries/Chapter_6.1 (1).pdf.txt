Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a concept in which we can divide the devices logically on layer 2. A broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the devices in the same broadcast domain will receive it. Through VLAN, different small- size sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle. VLAN ranges: ● VLAN 0, 4095: These are reserved VLAN which cannot be seen or used.● VLAN 1: It is the default VLAN of switches. By default, all switch ports are in VL.
